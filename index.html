    <p class="introtext">Earthquakes, one of the most catastrophic natural disasters known to 
        humankind, are happending frequently around the world. Also, earthquakes are 
        geological events that can strike with little warning, causing widespread 
        destruction and loss of life. Understanding the trends and potential locations of 
        earthquakes and their effects on the planet is crucial for us, scientists, 
        and policymakers to develop effective strategies for mitigating their 
        impact. While small earthquakes happening every day around the world, we
        focus on large scale earthquakes that may cause disasters to human and our
        environments. In the following questions and visulizations about the 782 huge earthquakes worldwise,
        which starting from Januarty 1st 2001 to January 1st 2023, </p>

    We display the magnitude of the earthquakes and their locations following the year sequence. <br>
    We can roughly recognize the earthquake bands by the frequency and intensity of earthquakes in different regions.
    The majority of earthquakes were happended along the costal areas of the continents.

    By clicking magnitude and depth buttons, we can visualize scales of magnitude 
    and depth at each earthquake locations.<br>
    For those earthquakes which have larger magnitude, they are more likely to have 
    larger depth. And the depth of earthquakes that occur in coastal regions 
    is deeper than those that occur inland.

    </table>
    <p class="explain">
    By brushing the areas in the plot, we can select earthquakes in our selected area.<br>
    From the scatter plot, it is clear that there are some positive correlations between significance
    and maximum estimated instrumental intensity of the earthquakes.
    For those earthquakes which have larger significance about the impact of 
    earthquakes on human and planet,they have larger estimated intensity by equipments.
    This demonstrating that when the instrument detected large intensity on a earthquake,
    people and government should take more actions to prevent further following damages of the earthquakes.

<p class="question">Question 4: What is the distribution of average earthquakes over years?</p>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="explain">
    From the bar plot, it can be found out that the year 2009, 2012, and 2021 have
    larger scale earthquakes on average than all other years. While the earthquakes
    are such an unpredicting activities causing by collisions under the ground, we
    may notice that following the years which have relatively lower average magnitude of 
    earthquake, there will be larger average magnitude of earthquakes in the next few years.
    This gives us hint that we need to cautious about the year which the magnitude of earthquakes
    that happended in the previous years are not super high.

                The color channel represents different kinds of alerts associated with earthquakes</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="explain">
    From the stacked bar plot, it is clear that before 2012, the alert system of large
    earthquakes is not developed yet, since only one very large earthquake was alerted.
    But with the aadvancement of earthquake monitoring equipments, people are alerted
    with different kinds of earthquakes. Starting from 2013, we can see that most of
    the alerts for earthquakes are green, demonstrating that for many large earthquakes,
    the impact to people may not be so large. Associated with the location of earthquakes
    in previous plots, it can be infered that since many earthquakes happened under the
    sea where no one lives there or in around places where only few people live, although
    many earthquakes happended, only some of them will be red alerted to human.

                The Y position channel represents the magnitude of large earthquakes.<br>
            </td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
    </table>
    <p class="explain">
    From the box plot, we found out that 50% of earthquakes for both Tsunami tiggered or not
    have magnitude of 6 and 75% of earthquakes are under magnitude of 7. It is not
    clear that there is a strong relationship between the happening of tsunima and 
    the magnitude of the earthquakes. This also demonstrated
    that the cause of Tsunami may not only depend on the magnitude of earthquake, although
    we sometimes think the larger earthquakes are more like to trigger tsunami. 
    The predictions of tsunami also needs the geographic locations for the earthquakes
    for people and government.

<p class="question">Conclusion:</p>
<div class="text">
    <p class="conclusion">By the explorations on huge earthquakes data, we can find
        the earthquake bands on the map, and find out that more earthquakes were
        happening along the costal areas. By tracking earthquake frequency, magnitude, and location, scientists 
        can better understand the patterns of seismic activity and develop models for 
        predicting future earthquakes.<br>
        <br>
        However, it's important to note that the nature of earthquakes is still
        unpredictable and there will always be some level of uncertainty in 
        earthquake forecasting. Despite advances in technology and seismic monitoring, 
        it's impossible to predict exactly when and where an earthquake will occur or how severe it will be.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, it's important for individuals and communities to be 
        prepared for earthquakes by taking steps such as securing buildings and 
        having emergency plans in place.
